# Milk

Milk's purpose is to be completelly simple  
Made only because I want to know how  
programming languages are made  

To start, I want to make it simple manipulate  
numbers  

No, I don't have any idea about how to create  
this, I don't know Assembly, but this is it.  
I beat the whole Dark Souls Saga, why not this?  

---

- [Assembly notes](./asm.md)
- This project is so fucking impossible so I'll often interrupt it (Old note I just left here about 6 months ago, on my last time looking at this)
- It's called **Milk** as a tribute to a youtube channel called **JogandoFoddaci**
