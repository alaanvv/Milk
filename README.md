# Milk

Milk's purpose is to be completelly simple  
Made only because I want to know how  
programming languages are made  

To start, I want to make it simple manipulate  
numbers  

No, I don't have any idea about how to create  
this, I don't know Assembly, but this is it.  
I beat the whole Dark Souls Saga, why not this?

# Add/Fix

- Everything '-'
- Variables
  
- Sum, substraction, multiplication, division
- And, or, not

---

# Notes

- `asm` folder will store Assembly codes that  
  seems to be important as commands or basic  
  things
- I will do the `asm` part first, so then I'll  
  see how to join everything
- This project is so fucking impossible so I'll often interrupt it
- I can start doing it in the wrong way (idk what's the right way), like, using python or javascript with some regex to replace the code by assembly
- Divide the code in lines, splitting on \n, then divide this lines in parts, splitting on spaces, so I can iterate this to read the commands
