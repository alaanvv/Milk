# Milk

Milk's purpose is to be completelly simple  
Made only because I want to know how  
programming languages are made  

To start, I want to make it simple manipulate  
numbers  

No, I don't have any idea about how to create  
this, I don't know Assembly, but this is it.  
I beat the whole Dark Souls Saga, why not this?  

---

# Add/Fix

- Everything '-'
- Mathematic basic stuff like sum and division
- Variables

---

# Notes

- `asm` folder will store Assembly codes that  
  seems to be important as commands or basic  
  things
- I will do the `asm` part first, so then I'll  
  see how to join everything
